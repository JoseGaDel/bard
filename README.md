# BARD (Biodiversity API Retrieval & Data-processing)

BARD is a comprehensive Python framework designed to simplify and enhance interactions with biodiversity databases, specifically tailored for the MINKA platform but adaptable to other similar APIs. This tool bridges the gap between complex API structures and end-users, enabling efficient data retrieval and processing for biodiversity research and citizen science initiatives. Developed with the colaboration of the [MINKA project](https://minka-sdg.org/) as part of a master's thesis in computational science and mathematics from URV & UOC.

## Key Features:

- **Automated API Interaction**: Seamlessly handles API calls, authentication, and response parsing.
- **Flexible Query Building**: Implements security mechanisms to ensure correct wueries and allows for lousy input so the user does not have to adhere to a strict fromat.
- **Spatial Data Processing**: Includes tools for geographical data analysis and visualization.
- **Temporal Data Handling**: Facilitates time-based data retrieval and analysis.
- **Data Transformation**: Offers some JSON data manipulation and filtering capabilities.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Designed with modularity in mind for easy expansion and customization.

BARD aims to democratize access to biodiversity data, empowering researchers, citizen scientists, and conservationists to contribute more effectively to global biodiversity monitoring and research efforts.
